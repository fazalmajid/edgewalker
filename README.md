# edgewalker
An opinionated DIY VPN setup script based on
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/), [OpenIKED](https://www.openiked.org),
[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com) and
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

## Rationale

Most VPN services are
[untrustworthy](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/16/most-free-vpn-apps-secretly-owned-by-china/).
You depend on the VPN provider's assurances to protect your privacy, which
completely defeats the purpose of a VPN. The only way you can be sure is to
run your own, but baroque network protocols engendering complex software makes
it difficult to do so even for the technically savvy.

[Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) was one of the first
efforts to automate the process, using cloud virtual servers as the hosts
operating the VPN. Trail of Bits implemented
[Algo](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/12/12/meet-algo-the-vpn-that-works/)
to simplify it and remove some questionable choices Streisand made (although,
to be fair, the Streisand project seems to have jettisoned many of them and
converged on WireGuard).

Edgewalker is similar, but [awesomer](https://xkcd.com/483/):

* It is based on [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/), widely considered the
  most secure general-purpose OS, rather than Linux.
* Like Algo, it implements IPsec/IKEv2/MOBIKE rather than OpenVPN (read the
  [Algo announcement](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2016/12/12/meet-algo-the-vpn-that-works/)
  for the reasons why).
  * IPsec/IKEv2 works out of the box on iOS, iPadOS and macOS.
  * In theory on Windows as well, although I have no idea how to make it work
    or simplify setup, any help is welcome.
* It also implements WireGuard (recommended for Linux and Android, along with
  travel VPN-capable routers like the
  [GL.iNet Mango](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt300n-v2/))
* It uses QR codes to simplify installation as much as possible on the client
  devices.
* It uses [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) so your IPsec certificates
  just work (WireGuard does not rely on PKI).
* It uses its own [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) DNS
  server with DNSSEC validation support, for better privacy
* It has no dependencies on Ansible, Python or anything else exotic you need
  to add on your own machine, other than a SSH client.
* It is just a shell script with little bits of Python thrown in like
  [Acme-Tiny](https://github.com/diafygi/acme-tiny), and easily auditable.

While you can run the script again as your Let's Encrypt certificates expire
(although it generates new credentials each time), I recommend simply
destroying the VM and creating a new one. Of course, if you are running on
physical hardware, you will want to rerun the script. If using WireGuard only,
you don't need to rerun the script as WireGuard keys do not expire and there
are no certificates.

## Prerequisites

You need:

* A Let's Encrypt account and key (I'm working on setting this up
  automatically for you, in the meantime you can use Step 1 on
  [this page](https://gethttpsforfree.com/) to do that for you).
* An OpenBSD machine reachable from the Internet (it can be a physical machine
  you own, or a cloud VM like [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)).
* The ability to add a DNS record for the machine's IP address (IPv4 only for
  now).
* The 80x25 OpenBSD console does not support UTF-8 and cannot display the QR
  code in a single screen. Use a different terminal, or enter the profile URL
  by hand.

If you have a firewall in front of the OpenBSD machine, it needs to allow the
following inbound traffic (possibly using static port mappings if you use
NAT):

* SSH (TCP port `22`) so you can actually log in to your machine.
* HTTP (TCP port `80`) and HTTPS (TCP port `443`) to allow Let's Encrypt
  certificate issual and allow you to get the Apple-format Profiles that will
  ease setup on your iDevice.
* UDP ports `500` (IKE), `1701` (IPsec) and `4500` (IPsec NAT traversal).
* Optionally IPsec protocols `ESP` (IP protocol number `50`, hex `0x32`)) and
  `AH` (decimal `51` hex `0x33`) and ESP for maximum efficiency, although many
  firewalls won't support this.
* UDP port `51820` (WireGuard).

## Instructions

* Clone this repository into one of your own.
* Edit the first lines in the script edgewalker.sh (`X509` and
  `USERNAME`). Not strictly necessary, but make it your own.
* Log in as root on your OpenBSD machine, then:
  ```
   pkg_add wget
   wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GITHUB_ACCOUNT_HERE/edgewalker/main/edgewalker.sh
   sh -e edgewalker.sh
   ```
* The script will ask you for:
  * The DNS name of your OpenBSD machine.
  * To copy-paste your Let's Encrypt account key in PEM format.
* It will then obtain Let's Encrypt certificates, generate a QR code that you
  can use to download the profile on your iDevice to set up the VPN.

* The OpenBSD team, for making their wonderful security-focused OS.
* Reyk Fl√∂ter for making OpenIKED, a breath of fresh air in the unnecessarily
  convoluted world of VPN software.
* Jason A. Donenfeld for inventing WireGuard.
* Let's Encrypt, for making certificates cheap and easy.
* Daniel Roesler for the fantastic Acme-Tiny.

## Demo

I created a fresh OpenBSD 6.8 VM `vpn42.majid.org` on Vultr ([see how](https://vimeo.com/485215180)), and here is what the experience looks like:

This [Vimeo video](https://vimeo.com/485183891) shows how to use the generated QR code on an iPhone.
